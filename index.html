            <li class="shadow"><span> A Platform: Mac, Windows or Chrome OS?</span>
                <br>Most laptops come with one of three operating systems: Windows, Chrome OS or MacOS (for MacBooks only). Choosing the right one is a personal preference <br>
                Windows 10 <br>
                <p>The most flexible operating system, Windows, runs on more laptop models than Chrome OS or Mac OS X. Windows notebooks range in price from under $150 to several thousand dollars and offer a wide array of features from touch screens to fingerprint readers to dual graphics chips. Windows 10, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, provides a number of improvements over Windows 7 and 8, including the ability to switch between tablet and desktop modes, a revamped Start menu with live tiles and the powerful Cortana digital assistant. </p>
                Apple MacOS Catalina
                <p>All MacBooks come with Apple's latest desktop operating system, macOS Catalina. Overall, the operating system offers similar functionality to Windows 10, but with a different take on the interface that substitutes an apps dock at the bottom of the screen for Microsoft's Start menu and taskbar. Instead of the Cortana digital assistant, Mac users get Siri. They can also perform transactions with Apple Pay, take calls or texts from their phones and unlock their laptops with an Apple Watch. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="shadow"> <span>Performance</span>
                <br> A laptop Performance is based on 5 main pillars. <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Processor</li>
                    <li>RAM</li>
                    <li>Internal Storage</li>
                    <li>Battery</li>
                    <li>Graphics Card</li>
                </ol>

                The processor  is your Brain.The more powerful a brain,the more it can do and do it faster. 

            </li>

            <li class="shadow"> <span>Display</span> 
                <br> Display quality is about much more than resolution. IPS panels range in color and brightness, so read our reviews to find out if the laptop your considering has a good display. We typically look for an sRGB color rating of over 100% and brightness great than 300 nits results. If you want the very best picture quality and don't care about battery life, consider an OLED display. You should also keep an eye out for upcoming display technology to hit laptops, including miniLED.  </li>
            <li class="shadow"> <span>Size</span>
                <br>Before you look at specs or pricing, you need to figure out just how portable you need your laptop to be. Laptops are usually categorized by their display sizes: <br>
                11 to 12 inches: The thinnest and lightest systems around have 11- to 12-inch screens and typically weigh 2.5 to 3.5 pounds. <br>
                13 to 14 inches: Provides the best balance of portability and usability, particularly if you get a laptop that weighs under 4 pounds. <br>
                15 to 16 inches: The most popular size, 15-inch laptops usually weigh 4 to 5.5 pounds. Consider this size if you want a larger screen and you're not planning to carry your notebook around often. Laptops with 16-inch displays are rare but Apple might get the trend started with its 16-inch MacBook Pro. <br>
                17 to 18 inches: If your laptop stays on your desk all day every day, a 17- or 18-inch system could provide you with the kind of processing power you need to play high-end games or do workstation-level productivity. <br>
